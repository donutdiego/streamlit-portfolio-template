## Streamlit Personal Portfolio Template ##

After learning how to create a personal portfolio page using Streamlit and simple Python code, I wanted to share a template that can help others create something similar. I took inspiration from the YouTube channel, "Coding Is Fun", and used [this video](https://youtu.be/VqgUkExPvLY) to learn the fundamentals of Streamlit. 

### Steps: ###
Create an account at [Streamlit.io](https://streamlit.io/)
Fork this repository or copy the code of the portfolio.py script.
